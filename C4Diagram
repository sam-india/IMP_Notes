1. Agentic AI Model – Data Flow Chart

2. General vs Specialized Training Flow

@startuml
!include https://raw.githubusercontent.com/plantuml-stdlib/C4-PlantUML/master/C4_Container.puml

Person(annotator, "Business Users / SMEs", "Provide labeled tasks, domain expertise")
System_Boundary(training, "Training Pipeline") {
  
  Container(genModel, "General Foundation Model", "LLM (e.g., Copilot, GPT)", "Pre-trained general AI capabilities")
  Container(specialModel, "Specialized Model", "Fine-tuned / domain-specific", "Trained for KYC, AML, Fraud, etc.")
  Container(trainingData, "Training Data", "Documents, APIs logs, workflows", "Used for supervised fine-tuning or RAG")
  Container(ragStore, "Knowledge Store", "Vector DB / Policy DB", "Stores policies, compliance docs, embeddings")
}

Rel(annotator, trainingData, "Provides annotations, corrections")
Rel(trainingData, genModel, "Used for fine-tuning / prompts")
Rel(genModel, specialModel, "Specialization via fine-tuning / adapters")
Rel(specialModel, ragStore, "Uses domain knowledge via RAG")
Rel(specialModel, annotator, "Delivers specialized insights")

3. CogniAiOps Overall Architecture (with MCP, RAG, Multi-Bot/Model)

@startuml
!include https://raw.githubusercontent.com/plantuml-stdlib/C4-PlantUML/master/C4_Component.puml

Person(user, "End Users", "Analysts, Compliance Officers, Fraud Teams")

System_Boundary(cogni, "CogniAiOps Platform") {
  
  Container(mcp, "Model Control Plane (MCP)", "Manages lifecycle of AI models/bots")
  Container(rag, "RAG Engine", "Retrieval Augmented Generation", "Fetches from KB, vector DB, policy store")
  Container(botManager, "Multi-Agent/Bot Orchestrator", "Agentic Framework", "Assigns tasks across specialized AI agents")
  Container(security, "RBAC + Policy Layer", "Access control & compliance enforcement")

}

System_Ext(apps, "Enterprise Applications", "KYC, AML, Fraud, Core Banking")

Rel(user, botManager, "Natural Language tasks & queries")
Rel(botManager, rag, "Fetches domain knowledge & compliance policies")
Rel(botManager, mcp, "Delegates to right AI model/bot")
Rel(mcp, apps, "Triggers specialized API calls via adapters")
Rel(apiLayer, apps, "Executes workflow tasks")

✅ These cover:

1. Agentic AI Model (data flow)


2. General + Specialized Training process


3. CogniAiOps overall architecture with MCP, RAG, multi-bot orchestration



Would you like me to also merge all 3 into one consolidated high-level diagram (to show progression from training → agentic AI model → CogniAiOps platform)?
