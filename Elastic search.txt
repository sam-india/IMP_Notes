1 row in RDBMS is considered as one document in elastic search in json format

table name in DB is Type in elastic search

in db we have a db schema, in elastic search we have index

in Elastic search, Cluster is the place where i am going to store my entire data.

its a collection of one or more nodes that together holds your entire data and provide federated index and search capabilities accross all nodes.

Node is a single server that stores data and participate in clustering, node is by default called as uuid - universaly unique identifier and each nodes can have n no of shards and replica 
localhost:9200/_cat/indices?v&pretty
health status index 		uuid
green 	open 	employee	fdgffg5gf8g8df78f78gd8f7g It means taht the data from employee index is stored in this uuid.

shards: suppose we have very large data of about 1 tb which we are storing in a single node, this can cause performancee issue
to resolve this we can distribute this data in multiple shards and multiple nodes
Shards help us to allow horizonatally split or scale our data volume and nodes also keeps replica of shards, so in case if any shards fails replica can be used 
to access the data

keeping multiple server/node help us to increase performanceeif we have a single node and 8 shards and replicas then we need to search data in all the shards
but if we split this data in 2 nodes then the shards are also devided into 4 X 4 in each noded now searching will happen in first node first and it will much faster in this kind of distirbuted setup

RDBMS				-> DB Schema		-> Table		-> column/row
ELASTIC SEARCH		-> index			-> types		-> documenyt with property

mapping is a process of defining that how a documnt and the field it contains are stored and indexed
lik in a employee index what is a dATA TYPE Of employee id like integer , data type of employee name is text etc

elatic search provide DSL domain specif language based on JSON

leaf qry clause looks for a perticular value in a particular field   such as match term range

compound qry clause wrap other leaf or compound qry and are used to combine multiple qry in logical fashion
