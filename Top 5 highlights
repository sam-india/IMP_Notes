🔝 5 Key Points to Always Mention

1. The Problem → Enterprise apps are non-AI native, siloed, and lack unified AI integration → causing compliance risk, higher costs, and scalability issues.


2. The Solution → A reusable Agentic AI layer (CogniAIOps) that plugs into any enterprise system, enabling natural language task execution, cross-app workflows, and built-in compliance.


3. How It Works → User actions/prompts → intercepted → orchestrated by federated AI layer (Prompt UI, Orchestrator, RAG Corpus) → executes across multiple systems (KYC, AML, Fraud, Risk, Audit).


4. Business Value →

30–40% analyst capacity freed (automation, fewer errors, faster SLAs)

$35–40M annual savings from productivity gains & reduced regulatory exposure.



5. Strategic Advantage → Creates a federated AI foundation for risk, compliance, governance, and operations → scalable, explainable, and future-ready AI enterprise.
